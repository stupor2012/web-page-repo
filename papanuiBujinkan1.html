      <h3>About Bujuinkan</h3>
		<b><i>this is git hub practies</i></b>
      <p>Bujinkan Budō Taijutsu training does not include participation in competitions or contests, as the school's training aims to develop the ability to protect oneself and others using techniques that focus on disabling an attacker (or removing their desire/ability to continue) as efficiently as possible.<br>

<p>This training is conducted in a manner in which there are predefined "attackers" (tori) and "receivers" (uke) similar to drills in judo (gokyo) or traditional Japanese martial arts. However, the Bujinkan differs from many traditional martial arts in that the training progresses through the following stages:</p><br>

<p>Predefined sets of movements (kata) and physical conditioning
Variations to the fixed drills (henka), responding to changes in the attacker's movements or situation
Free form training (randori) consisting mostly of spur-of-the-moment, dynamic techniques during which the defender hits, locks, chokes or throws the attacker in a controlled and safe manner
More advanced training consists of controlling the attacker's mind using various techniques such as pain compliance and deception
Training is done in a manner that entails little risk of permanent injury.</p><br>

<p>The Bujinkan does not adhere to any official guideline or set of rules to limit actions or techniques used during training. The approach used in the Bujinkan includes gaining compliance through pain and utilising potentially damaging techniques in order to survive dangerous situations rather than focusing on winning a competition or evenly matched duel.[8] As a result, many of the staple responses of a Bujinkan student would be inappropriate in most competitions. Also of note is that, unlike competition martial arts, Bujinkan training does not involve testing techniques (locks, throws, chokes, strikes, etc.) against a fully resisting opponent. This being the case, Bujinkan as a means of self defence is a purely theoretical concept but is obviously based on many centuries of battlefield experience and the survival of people and techniques against the test of war.</p><br>

The Bujinkan largely focuses on “taijutsu” (body movement / skills) as well as other skills of ninjutsu (ninpo tactics and strategies) and happo biken jutsu (various modern and traditional weapons) - this is The Bujinkan's branch of Kukishin-ryū.</p>

      <h4>Taijutsu</h4>
      <p>Taijutsu (body combat art) is the Bujinkan system of unarmed defence using strikes, throws, holds, chokes and joint locks. It encompasses skill such as: koppo jutsu is the "way of attacking and/or using the skeletal structure"; “koshi jutsu” is the way of attacking muscles and weak points on the body; jutai jutsu is the "relaxed body method" teaching throwing, grappling and choking techniques and dakentai jutsu which emphasises strikes, kicks and blocks.</p>

      <h4>Tori and Uke</h4>
      <p>Training begins with two partners practicing pre-arranged forms (waza or kata) and then advancing to unlimited variations of those forms (henka). The basic pattern is for the Tori (Tori, or the person applying the technique) to initiate a technique against the person who receives the technique</p>

      <h4>Ukemi and balance</h4>
      <p>Bujinkan taijutsu seeks to use body movement and positioning rather than strength to defeat the opponent. All techniques in Bujinkan taijutsu involve unbalancing the opponent while maintaining one's own balance. This is achieved by moving the opponent into inferior positions and manipulating their body along weak lines where it is difficult for the opponent to resist. The attacker continuously seeks to regain balance and cover vulnerabilities (such as an exposed side), while the defender uses position and timing to keep the attacker off balance and vulnerable.</p>

      <h4>Physical conditioning</h4>
      <p>unan taiso (junan meaning flexible) is a yogic method of stretching and breathing[14] by means of which the Bujinkan practitioner may develop and maintain good physical condition and wellbeing. The exercises promote relaxation, blood circulation, muscle toning and flexibility,[15] and form a core part of all training sessions. Junan taiso is a form of conditioning and preparation for the body. All major joints are rotated and stretched in a proper manner while healthy breathing and concentration are practiced</p>
